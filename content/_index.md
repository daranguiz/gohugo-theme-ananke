Urasenke Practitioners in Colorado is a home for those interested in studying the Japanese Way of Tea in the [Urasenke](https://www.urasenke.or.jp/texte/) style. Through personal practice and public outreach, we strive to make tea available for our community.

If you are interested in taking lessons, or if you would like to schedule a demonstration, please let us know through the [Contact](/contact) link above.
